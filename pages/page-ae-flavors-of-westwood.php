Patel said he is especially proud of his chicken tikka masala &ndash; roasted chicken<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in a spicy, creamy orange sauce &ndash; and freshly baked naan bread.</p><p>Yet, Patel said what sets this South Asian eatery apart from many others is Patel&rsquo;s experience studying in multiple cooking schools throughout the world and serving as a longtime celebrity chef.</p><p>Patel immigrated to the U.S. from India in 1988 after attending an Italian culinary school in Panama and then culinary school in India. Working several years as sous chef at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Patel said he was approached by associates of Michael Jackson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to become Jackson&rsquo;s personal chef.</p><p>Patel said he was reticent at first, but eventually accepted, preparing meals of various cultures for the Jackson family, including Japanese, American and Italian. Through the Jackson family, Patel gained connections and periodically cooked for celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Harrison Ford.</p><p>In 2001, Patel said he decided he wanted to go his own way and manage his own eatery. With the support of the Jackson family, who still eats at his restaurant regularly and introduced now-loyal customer Forest Whitaker, Patel founded Bollywood Bites.<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Patel said the inspiration for the name came from his family in India, who is involved in the Bollywood film industry. However, the idea for the restaurant came from fast-food chains.</p><p>&ldquo;My goal was to make Bollywood Bites a top Indian fast-food franchise similar to Jack in the Box, but healthy,&rdquo; Patel said.</p><p>For this reason, Patel instituted the $5 Bruin Bowl, which serves a smaller yet still filling portion<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of dishes like chicken curry. Patel said Bollywood Bites is also mobile and spreading, with restaurants in Santa Monica and a food truck. He said he is also working on securing a Bollywood Bites in Las Vegas.</p><p>Despite celebrities frequenting his restaurant and grand economies to scale, Patel said his No. 1 focus is providing customers with an enjoyable experience.</p><p>&ldquo;The moment people come in, they see it is clean and our restaurant is full of happy colors,&rdquo; Patel said. &ldquo;We have the best service, the best food and we always tell our chefs to put their hearts into their food.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="large-4 columns">' ,

Its signature dishes are its bourbon buffalo wings with a Jack Daniel&rsquo;s barbeque bourbon sauce and jalape&ntilde;o mac and cheese.</p><p>The Glendon has been open in Westwood since April of 2010.

Named Chilly Ribbons, the eatery is a shaved snow franchise based in Florida and owned by Scott Colwell. <br/><br/> Chilly Ribbons, located at 1135 Westwood Blvd., offers flavorful options for shaved snow along with free choice of toppings and syrups.<br/><br/> Not quite shaved ice nor frozen yogurt, shaved snow, popular in Taiwan, is relatively new to North America and is produced with machines that shave flavored ice blocks into thin, overlapping waves or “ribbons.”<br/><br/> “Shaved snow (in general) is different in that we actually infuse real fruit and natural flavors with a little bit of cream and sugar into the water before we freeze it,” Kultran said. “If you’re someone who’s looking for a healthier, lower-calorie, lower-sugar option, this is the treat for you.”<br/><br/> Although Kultran grew up helping in his family’s Thai restaurant business, being in the food industry was not his original intention. Having graduated from USC with a master’s degree in electrical engineering in 2005, Kultran worked for an engineering firm for a long time before realizing that owning his own business could be enjoyable.<br/><br/>A conversation about the frozen dessert sparked over dinner two years ago with Kim, his then-neighbor, which led to their agreed partnership in managing the California market for Chilly Ribbons.<br/><br/>“(Shaved snow) could be the next big thing if we can make it for the American palate,” Kultran had said to Kim.<br/><br/>These days, Kultran’s favorite shaved snow flavor is coconut, but it is how he describes his choice of toppings that hints at his flair for flavorful experimentation.<br/><br/>“I put coconut shaved snow with almonds and chocolate drizzle, so it tastes just like frozen Almond Joy, the candy bar,” Kultran said.<br/><br/>As for the customers, the top-five most popular flavors are Thai tea, coconut, green tea, mango and strawberry.<br/><br/><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2014/03/bd5612f2-df73-4af6-aed8-e72c3c7caee5-300x198.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Tamaryn Kong / Daily Bruin</span></div>Kultran said he hopes that eventually Chilly Ribbons will become a household name. Meanwhile, the main goal is for shaved snow to gain traction among customers. In this effort, Chilly Ribbons has reached out to UCLA students, giving out free samples during Greek Week, donating money to sororities and fraternities and helping fundraise for the campus’ Hooligan Theatre Company.<br/><br/>Even with business expansion and increasing public attention in the works, he said Chilly Ribbons focuses on customer satisfaction.<br/><br/>“What really makes me smile is getting a new customer who’s never had this product before,” Kultran said. “The first time they put it in their mouths, (they say) ‘wow’ since they’ve never had it elsewhere.”</div><div class="large-4 columns">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1135 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 270-0926</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Sun 12 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.</li>          <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> No Wi-Fi.

While most guests departed at reasonable hours, one by the name of Bob Jaffe refused to leave.</br></br>Jaffe had just bought a corner shop bakery in the heart of Westwood Village, and was set on showing it to his friend. Berman eventually gave in and went down to see the shop in the middle of the night.</br></br>Berman, who himself was already in the bakery business, said he knew Jaffe was bringing him down to the shop to convince him to go into business together. Berman said he remained skeptical up until they stepped into the shop.</br></br>&#34;It was the middle of the night and (Jaffe) brought me into this tiny little shop right here. Then I knew I&#39;d be making doughuts for a long time,&#34; Berman said.</br></br>On the spot, the two became business partners and opened their establishment as the Corner Shoppe Bakery the very next morning.</br></br> Throughout the years, there have been three generations of Bermans working behind the cozy bakery counter selling the large variety of signature doughnuts Stan&#39;s has to offer. Yet, neither Berman&#39;s children, nor his grandchildren wanted to stay in the bakery business long-term, so Berman himself continues to come into work every day.</br></br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/5d7b5ea6-a5be-4364-aa21-8475d2f416ac-300x236.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Neil Bedi / Daily Bruin senior staff</span></div>With about half a century under his belt, Berman has said he&#39;s gotten to know a number of the UCLA chancellors, professors and students. For a long time, he said he had a good partnership going with the school and was selling about 150 dozen donuts per day to campus.</br></br>Among these hundreds of doughnuts sold, the Huelle stands out as Stan&#39;s Donuts&#39; No. 1 seller. The pastry is popular for its creamy peanut butter center and decadent chocolate glaze.

Students and Westwood natives alike had come to check out the new hot dog place. Despite an hourlong fryer break down, the crowds remained and returned for a second day as well.</br></br>For owner Gary Budish, the opening of the restaurant was a dream he realized post-retirement. Budish, who considers himself a businessman, said the restaurant business wasn&#39;t something he ever really envisioned himself pursuing, but that when he retired he found himself unsatisfied without any work to do.</br></br>Only two months into his retirement, Budish discovered the original Fab Hot Dogs through the Food Network show &#34;Diners, Drive-in&#39;s and Dives.&#34; Blown away by the food, it took him only a year to become friends with the owner Joe Fabrocini, secure the rights to Fab Hot Dogs and get right to work in Westwood.</br></br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/a90e0ffc-63a8-4aef-9946-6946ec5dfb77-300x218.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Kelsey Rocha / Daily Bruin</span></div>Budish and his lifelong friends Loren Harmell and Andy Fox co-own the business with Fabrocini acting as a consultant. Because none of the three have any restaurant experience, their roles revolve more around controlling the quality of the food and in building the Fab Hot Dog experience for customers. It isn&#39;t uncommon to see them hustling about the restaurant.</br></br>Fox said while they opted to replicate a lot of Fab&#39;s original concept, they sought to modernize it and create an atmosphere that would appeal more to college students. With patio seating, rustic brick walls and brightly colored decor, the restaurant captures a fresh diner-fusion look.</br></br>Harmell said another youthful component is the restaurant&#39;s &#34;I Ate It All&#34; challenge. Customers who successfully eat their way through every item on the menu earn themselves a spot on the wall of fame. That means challengers are looking at trying 19 types of hot dogs, 14 different burgers and a multitude of crispy, fried sides among other Fab Hot Dog delicacies.</br></br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/701ab19c-7e19-44f8-9da2-f77f187f76f8-300x182.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Neil Bedi / Daily Bruin</span></div>The proximity to UCLA is something the owners are all excited about. Budish said they have planned late hours Thursday through Saturday hoping to be the go-to hang out for post-game celebrations.</br></br>Budish, who has a particular affinity for UCLA sports, said he is a close personal friend to a number of directors in the athletic department, and said having their flagship store in Westwood is an especially rewarding experience.</br></br>&#34;I&#39;m a big sports donor through the Wooden Athletic Fund. I never miss a basketball game; I never miss a football game,&#34; Budish said. &#34;I support the school whole-heartedly and it&#39;s a dream to have a location that is this close to the school.&#34;</div><div class="large-4 columns">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 920 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 794-0333</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Wed 11 a.m. - 10 p.m.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thu 11 a.m. - midnight</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri 11 am - 1 am</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat noon - 1 am</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun noon - 8 pm</li> <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: Yes</li>          <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> No alcohol.

It&#39;s used to celebrate and to mourn. It&#39;s really neat to see how it touches people,&#34; Cancelosi said. &#34;It&#39;s really a place to commune.&#34;<br/><br/>Napa Valley Grille, an asset of the Tavistock Group, opened in Westwood in 2000. Boudreax said as a social chef he was immediately drawn to the company for its emphasis on creating an intimate dining experience.<br/><br/>&#34;We firmly believe we&#39;re giving a personal experience, and what&#39;s more personal than food,&#34; Boudreaux said. &#34;There&#39;s a ton of blind faith in the guys behind the (kitchen) counter - that they&#39;re going to do right by you before they put it down in front of you. It&#39;s a leap of faith.&#34;<br/><br/>Boudreaux said their high-class New American menu seeks to serve the needs of guests with locally sourced, farm-to-table, seasonal cuisine. Quality proteins such as roasted chicken, grilled fillet mignon and pan seared duck are among the dinner selections, while the lunch menu boasts a variety of burgers, sandwiches and salads.<br/><br/>For Cancelosi, he said capturing a Napa moment with the atmosphere and flavors of the food is what sets the restaurant apart in the Los Angeles area.<br/><br/>Both Boudreaux and Cancelosi make a daily habit of circulating through the dining room and getting to know the guests. They both agree that they spend more time in the restaurant than at home and have expanded their definitions of family to include the staff of the restaurant as well as its guests.<br/><br/>&#34;(Napa Valley Grille) is an extension of your home family. In fact, I celebrated Christmas in the restaurant and brought my kids down,&#34; Cancelosi said. &#34;I opened the restaurant up to the staff and anyone else who wanted to come down for a glass of wine from 3-5.

Langford helped his wife, Sam, open the shop after they made the transition from Seattle to Southern California.<br><br>&#34;The beans we use, (which are from) Espresso Vivace, we drank &#46;&#46;&#46; everyday,&#34; said Langford. &#34;When we moved to (Los Angeles) there was nothing but Coffee Beans and Starbucks&#39;, so we thought this would probably do pretty well.&#34;<br><br>It was first known as West Burton Coffee and Tea, after a village in England, but later the name was changed to Espresso Profeta, a reference to David Schomer.

With a shared laugh, the co-founders of fundamental LA begin to share the story behind their restaurant&#39;s success.<br><br>"The idea behind fundamental was to take our love for hospitality and good food, technique and seasonality, and be our own destination among the many chain stores in Westwood," Lee said.<br><br>Southern California natives Lee and Faust first met in the second grade. After working in business management for three years, the UC Berkeley graduates decided it was time for a change. A few post-work drinks at The Surly Goat bar later, the concept of fundamental LA was born.<br><br>Initially reluctant about the cramped storefront on the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Wellworth Avenue, Lee and Faust said they saw a certain potential in the restaurant. Together, the team redesigned the tight space to fit fundamental&#39;s intimate, contemporary aesthetic.<br><br>When bar stools were out of their price range, Lee and Faust improvised. What started out as a series of sketches is now a fully upholstered series of bar stools made of plywood. A closer look reveals a vibrant red found on the underside of the seats; a secret touch that mimics the bottom of a Louis Vuitton shoe.<br><br>"It was a labor of love. It was frustrating and extremely time-consuming, but we saved money, and now there&#39;s a cooler story to tell," Faust said.<br><br>Fundamental LA opened its doors on June 13, 2011, and sits a few blocks away from the chain restaurants in Westwood Village.<br><br>"There are a lot of cheap, fast eats but not a lot of made-from-scratch cooking in sort of an upscale environment, which is what we are," Lee said.<br><br>To this day, Lee and Faust said they feel that the need for wholesome food is still extremely apparent in Westwood. A plethora of fresh herbs and seasonal vegetables appear on the menu, but they saidit&#39;s the farmer-chef relationships that make each meal at fundamental stand out.<br><br>"We go to the Santa Monica Farmers Market and forge these incredible conversations with some of the best food producers in the country. It&#39;s an opportunity to connect with the people who are growing the food, and it&#39;s a privilege to get to use their food," Faust said.<br><br>"There&#39;s a friendly food vendor there named Barbara who always remembers my name! And I have a (hard) name to remember," Lee said with a laugh.<br><br>It is this connection to the origins of their produce that fundamental LA thrives upon and hopes to show in their dishes. The restaurant also gives customers the chance to provide their own fresh ingredients.<br><br>"Neighbors even bring in huge bags of limes, fresh figs and avocados from their gardens, and have it cooked in the restaurant," Faust said.<br><br>Fundamental&#39;s sandwiches are what started it all, and the duo said choices like the albacore tuna sandwich remain a huge hit with customers.<br><br>"We use sashimi grade, fresh albacore that comes in daily. There&#39;s no mayo in the sandwich - we just toss it with olive oil and capers vend, avocado, sundried tomato, olives - and it&#39;s fresh and delicious," Lee said.<br><br>For dinner, Lee and Faust suggest the simple purity of the carrot risotto. The brussels sprouts drizzled with tom yum glaze are a popular dish that they saidadds an Asian influence to the menu.<br><br>The duo also recommends fundamental&#39;s freshly made vanilla cream soda, which they both said students especially will love.<br><br>"It&#39;s a house-made vanilla ice cream mixed with soda water and heavy cream, stirred up as a legitimate light, fluffy milkshake. Also the churros. You can&#39;t go wrong with the churros," Faust said.<br><br>As the business partners rapidly share items from their menu in bursts of passion, the topic shifts to what&#39;s in store for the future of fundamental LA.<br><br>"We&#39;re actually opening another fundamental, so that&#39;s top of the line for us right now. It&#39;s basically like what we do at lunch, but it won&#39;t be in Westwood, it will be further east," Lee said.<br><br>With abundant energy and an armful of seasonal produce, the duo anticipate a new chapter for fundamental LA will begin no later than mid-2014.</div><div class="large-4 columns">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1303 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 444-7581</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Tue-Fri 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tue-Thu 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri-Sat 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $$</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Street parking.</li> <li><i class="icon-globe"></i> <a href="//www.fundamental-la.com/" target="_blank">www.fundamental-la.com</a></li></ul></div></div>'

One week later, he decided that he was going to make crepes.<br><br>Fathi is the 28-year-old owner of Westwood&#39;s Mon Amour Cafe, which opened in February. Mon Amour Cafe offers everything from the classic strawberry Nutella crepe to more original options such as the Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup crepe or the filet mignon with blue cheese, sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onion crepe.<br><br>Fathi worked in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years, first as a busboy, then a waiter and finally a manager.<br><br>"I never thought to open up a creperie before, but I knew I wanted to do something sweet," Fathi said. "And I had some friends who were recently in Paris and they talked a lot about crepes."<br><br>To get inspired for his cafe, Fathi walked all around Westwood to explore the different types of food offered.<br><br>"I realized students didn&#39;t have many options as far as quick, sweet things," Fathi said. "I felt like a creperie would be a good addition to the village."<br><br>Once he settled on crepes, Fathi brought in a specialist to show him how to make the French sweet. Fathi experimented with different recipes and created the menu himself.<br><br>His personal favorite is the s&#39;mores crepe - a concoction of marshmallow cream, Nutella, cinnamon graham crackers, French vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and powdered sugar.<br><br>"It&#39;s like camping without any of the setup," Fathi said.<br><br>Mon Amour Cafe now offers macaroons, which are baked at night and rotate through 35 different flavors. Fathi&#39;s current favorite is the seasonal pumpkin spice macaroon.<br><br>Fathi said Mon Amour Cafe keeps late hours to accommodate Bruins. The cafe&#39;s earliest closing time is midnight, but it often stays open later.<br><br>"We never turn down customers," Fathi said. "On Thursday you might get a rush at 11:50 (p.m.), so I&#39;ll be here till 1:30 a.m. on those days."<br><br>Although students are its main fare, Mon Amour Cafe is sometimes visited by celebrities as well.<br><br>"We had (Metta World Peace) from the Lakers," Farthi said. "He practiced making crepes for all his friends one night here. We ended up making them for him."<br><br>Fathi said seeing positive customer reactions is the most satisfying part of his job.<br><br>"It&#39;s so rewarding to see students come in, happy that we&#39;re here," Fathi said.

As part of a small chain serving traditional American cuisine, the restaurant takes on dual roles as an eclectic lunchtime destination by day and a lively bar scene by night.<br><br>While the bar commonly plays host to beer-loving couples on first dates, it&#39;s also a great place for singles to meet. Larra&ntilde;aga said even one of Barney&#39;s own servers, a current UCLA student about to graduate, met her long-time boyfriend playing shuffleboard in the upper deck of the restaurant.<br><br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2014/02/b92b30c6-7105-44c1-8273-f00e46239a8d-300x198.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Agnijita Kumar / Daily Bruin senior staff</span></div>"It&#39;s a great place to meet someone, especially if you&#39;re a beer person and you&#39;re looking to meet another beer person, or someone into sports or even someone just interested in cool little restaurants."<br><br>Since the restaurant offers karaoke on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well as trivia on Wednesdays, Larra&ntilde;aga said the bar gets an animated crowd every night. In addition to its weekly events, the restaurant tends to throw events for various holidays. This Friday, in honor of Valentine&#39;s Day, Barney&#39;s quarterly stoplight party should be in full swing.<br><br>Larra&ntilde;aga said the point is for people to come wearing red, green or yellow to indicate their relationship status. Green communicates being single, yellow means it&#39;s complicated and red tells others that you are off the market. The event will also feature themed shots and free giveaways.<br><br>Larra&ntilde;aga said David Houston, owner of Barney&#39;s Beanery, chose to open the Westwood branch in part because of personal connections with doctors at the medical center and with people involved with UCLA athletics. She also said the restaurant is always open to supporting UCLA.<br><br>"We had UCLA sports radio hosted here throughout football season, and we&#39;ve had a lot of UCLA soccer alumni parties," Larra&ntilde;aga said. "(Houston) is really involved with (UCLA) sports."<br><br>In addition to hosting UCLA events, Barney&#39;s has a secret Bruin menu featuring items costing roughly five dollars. Beyond the Bruin menu, Barney&#39;s offers a broad spectrum of appetizers, burgers, Mexican favorites and American classics. Larra&ntilde;aga said the chili recipe dates back to the restaurant&#39;s inception in 1920.<br><br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2014/02/af49fd7e-11a8-42b2-bc79-746a584bfe4d-300x204.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Agnijita Kumar / Daily Bruin senior staff</span></div>Inside the restaurant, endless Christmas lights give a dreamy feeling, especially against the busy backdrop of license plates, album covers, magazine clippings and bottle caps which cover nearly every surface.<br><br>Barney&#39;s, which offers both cozy booths and breezy outdoor tables, attracts a mixed demographic, Larra&ntilde;aga said.<br><br>"A lot of people, when they think of Barney&#39;s they just think of &#39;bar&#39; and just young people, but we also get a lot of business people from Wilshire," Larra&ntilde;aga said.

"He asked me if I wanted to go out together. After two months, we got married. … That was amore."<br><br>In late December, the couple received a call from Gullotta&#39;s uncle living in Los Angeles. Her uncle said he wanted to open a new restaurant and asked if they would like to come to California and operate it.<br><br>"I worked in a restaurant in Taormina, Italy (as a manager) for 15 years," she said. "I like to serve food. I like it when I see people are very happy when they try authentic Italian food."<br><br>Three weeks later, they opened Donna Sophia together with Criscuolo&#39;s cousin, chef Gennaro Nasti, the vice champion of 2012 Pizzaioli Championship, a Neapolitan pizza competition featuring chefs from all around the world, in Naples, Italy.<br><br>The restaurant&#39;s arched doorway entrance and wooden door give its customers a sense of returning to a sweet home. Behind that door are chandeliers hanging elegantly from the ceiling over three rows of wooden square tables, a minimalistic design that captures tranquility and a vibe of romance.<br><br>To serve the most authentic Italian dish, chef Criscuolo and chef Nasti personally purchase the ingredients themselves and freshly prepare every kind of pasta, bread and pastries on their menu from scratch each morning.<br><br>Gullotta said her favorite Italian dish is "Gnocchi Filante," a first course on their daily menu, because it is a traditional dish in Sorrento where Criscuolo is from.

"(It is) a classic Mediterranean Italian flavor. ... It tastes sweet and soft."<br><br>To enhance the Italian flavor of the restaurant, Gullotta said Donna Sophia will be closed temporarily in a few months for her friend from Italy to come and install a pizza oven for chef Nasti to make traditional Neapolitan pizza.<br><br>"This is like my home." Gullotta said. "I have my husband and my cousin in the kitchen. We don&#39;t have any difference (in the restaurant) because this is a family.

He worked with his oldest brother at Drago, the family restaurant, for eight years before moving to open his own restaurant.<br><br>Drago first opened Tanino Ristorante in 1998. Despite the suggestions of family and friends to open a restaurant elsewhere, Drago said he loved Westwood Village and insisted it be located in Westwood. The restaurant, a mix of Italian cuisine with Californian flair, resides in one of the oldest buildings in the village.<br><br>"I first saw the building, and I fell in love," Drago said. "It looks like a Florentine building, and it is a great marriage with Italian cuisine."<br><br>The building, built in 1929, is elegant yet cozy, with high ceilings, brick walls, black and white floor tiles, and a bar with columns and arches. Tanino Ristorante is illuminated by dimly lit chandeliers and filled with peppy Italian music - the ambiance seemingly transports diners to Italy.<br><br>The menu includes a range of authentic Italian dishes, including pumpkin tortelloni and artichoke salad. Drago said his signature dish is his mushroom soup, and people come from all over Los Angeles for it.<br><br>"It is hard for even me to change the menu," Drago said. "And people miss the dishes when I do change it."<br><br>Drago works to bring the freshest ingredients to his guests. He said his first inspiration is quality.<br><br>"If you use quality, you will see and taste the results," Drago said.<br><br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="//dailybruin.com/images/2014/02/377ea95e-d01e-4616-8180-9cecf8cfd4d8-199x300.jpg" width="199"><span class="photocred-inline">Evaneet Sidhu / Daily Bruin</span></div>Aside from the daily a la carte items on the menu, Drago also includes seasonal daily specials. Guests will find seven to eight dish specials, such as white truffles or fettuccine with lamb ragout. Drago, who creates the menu, said Tanino Ristorante makes striped bass, sardines and langostinos, all imported daily from the Mediterranean for the freshest quality.<br><br>"I enjoy creating the daily special because it doesn&#39;t let me get bored with my menu," Drago said.<br><br>Tanino Ristorante is consistent not only with the food, but with the employees as well, Drago said. Some have worked with Drago since the restaurant opened.<br><br>Drago said he has expanded his connections from within the restaurant to UCLA and other businesses in Westwood over the last 15 years. Tanino Ristorante has frequently worked with Geffen Playhouse, and has built a relationship with Royce Hall and UCLA research departments.<br><br>"It is why after 16 years we are still successful," Drago said.

                '<p>Since its founding, Garlo’s Pies has grown to serve about 35,000 pies a day through a handful of franchise stores in Australia as well as a warehouse and export business for grocery stores and airlines. Westwood will be the franchise’s first international location.</p>',

                '<p>“We’ve always had a love affair with America,” Sean Garlick said. “We grew up on American television and probably know far more about American culture than you guys know about ours. So there’s still that novelty factor.”</p>',

                '<p>Knowing that they couldn’t rely on native Australians and tourists as their sole customer base, Garlick said they chose Westwood for its younger college crowd, hoping for a more open audience.</p>',

                '<p>Unlike the Garlo’s Pies locations back home, Garlick said the Westwood branch is focused on introducing Americans to savory pies with an Aussie dining experience.</p>',

                '<p>With ingredients imported directly from Australia to Westwood, each pie is crafted by Nathan Garlick and his team in front of customers, who can choose from a selection of about 10 savory pies and a few sweet pies, as well as an assortment of side dishes, desserts and Australian coffee. Among the list of fillings are chicken and vegetables, classic steak and curry lean beef.</p>',

                '<p>Unlike some traditional American pot pies, each Aussie pie has a pastry base, allowing for better portability and making a knife and fork unnecessary. The Aussie way to eat a pie, Garlick said, is oftentimes on the go and almost always with some tomato sauce – or as we call it, ketchup.</p>',

                '<p>The menu, condensed from its original form to ease in newcomers, also comes with a few local touches, including the fajita chicken pie and the mac and cheese pie slider.</p>',

                '<p>For the Westwood location’s barista and head of retail operations Donna Stoilova, who moved to Los Angeles from Australia to pursue acting, Garlo’s Pies brought a piece of home to the city.</p>',
