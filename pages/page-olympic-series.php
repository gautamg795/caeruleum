								<p>Adam Krikorian's Manhattan Beach home office isn't clean, but it isn't messy either – it's cluttered.</p>

								<p>Boxes line the wall of the office, filled with past photos and awards. Without the time to frame or hang them, 
									the women's water polo national team coach simply lets them sit there.</p>

								<p>Krikorian would use this space more often, he just doesn't have time with his busy travel schedule. 
									The women's national team is flying to places like Gouda, Netherlands, to qualify for the upcoming 
									Summer Olympics, and Shanghai, China. Needless to say, free time is rare these days.</p>
							
								<p>In one corner of the office is a framed John Wooden's "Pyramid of Success" with a personal note from
								 the famous basketball coach. It's the same one that only a handful of other UCLA coaches can proudly display.</p>


								<div class="pullquote">
									<p class="pullquotetext">
									  "When you end up deciding to coach at a place like UCLA, there's an unspoken rule that you're signing on
									   to be a disciple of coach Wooden whether you knew him or didn't know him."
									</p>
									<p class="quote-author">Krikorian</p>
								</div>

								 <p>“When I think back to my time, I certainly think of the great athletes and assistant coaches that I had,
								  but I can't help but to think of coach Wooden's influence not only on me, but the entire university," Krikorian said.</p>

								  <p>Krikorian saw how Wooden’s lessons were applicable to countless pursuits, including water polo. To this day, 
								  	he attributes much of his inspiration for his leadership style to the teachings of the revered coaching giant.</p>


								 <p>“When you end up deciding to coach at a place like UCLA, there's an unspoken rule that you're signing on to be a disciple
								  of coach Wooden whether you knew him or didn't know him," Krikorian said. “You better follow those principles,
								   those values and those standards.”</p>


								<p>One of the most successful names in the sport, Krikorian is currently in his seventh year as coach of the USA Water Polo 
									Women's Senior National Team. Before he began his national coaching career, Krikorian made significant contributions 
									to UCLA water polo as a player, assistant coach and head coach.</p>

								<p>A four-year letterman and two-time captain for the men’s team during his collegiate playing career, Krikorian guided the
								 Bruins to their first national championship since 1972 in 1995. His influence among his teammates earned him the title of
								  “Most Inspirational Player” during his last three seasons.</p>

										contributing to UCLA's first national championship since 1972 in 1995.
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>After graduation, Krikorian began serving the program as a coach and his impact only grew from there. 
									Krikorian racked up seven NCAA titles while at the helm of the women’s team. Amassing a trove of honors, 
									he has been named National Women’s Water Polo Coach of the Year on five different occasions. </p>

								

								<p>In both his roles as a player and coach, Krikorian helped win an unprecedented 15 national
								 championships in men’s and women’s water polo.</p>

								<p>Brandon Brooks, the current coach for UCLA's women’s team, has seen numerous Bruins graduate and join the coaching ranks 
									at other schools. As a result, the shared principles of Krikorian and Wooden have shaped teams like the University of
									 Hawai'i, UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego, to name a few.</p>

							

								<p>“You can imagine how teams across the country are taking early UCLA teams' success and putting that into their own teams,” Brooks said.
								 “It’s great for our sport, it’s great for our national teams and it’s great for our UCLA teams. For us, we have to continue to 
								 push and get better because I know personally that the other coaches expect excellence as well.”</p>

								 <p> <b>Bringing two worlds together</b></p>

								 <p>Since his national coaching debut in 2009, Krikorian has led the U.S. team to capture the gold in nine of 12 FINA Championships, including a gold medal at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.</p>
								 <p>Hoping to represent the United States in Rio this summer, the coach is embarking on his second Olympic journey. The first stop on the road to Rio is the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Gouda, Netherlands, from March 21 to 28.</p>
								 <p>Just a few weeks ago, Krikorian returned to Westwood with the national team to scrimmage the current Bruins. Playing at a place filled with countless memories for members of both parties, the national team came away with a 13-4 victory.</p>
								 <p>“They're obviously missing some players, which I've stolen from them,” Krikorian said. “They have plenty of talented players still on that team though and they look good. As always, I think there's three or four teams that can compete for a national championship and they're certainly one of them.”</p>
								 <p>One of those stolen players is junior attacker Kodi Hill, who is taking a year off from college to play for the national team.</p>
								 <p>“I've learned so much in the short time that I've been under him as the head coach,” Hill said. “A lot of us have been playing for 10, 12 years so I think it’s really special to show up everyday and learn something new. That's pretty rare.”</p>
								 <p>Although many newcomers to the national team have just started playing under Krikorian, veteran Courtney Mathewson has been at his side for 12 years.</p>
								 <p>A Bruin alum from the class of 2008, Mathewson earned Player of the Year honors and was one of five graduating seniors that year. A successful group, they became the second team and only women in UCLA history to win national titles in all four of their collegiate seasons.</p>

									</p>
									<p class="quote-author">Mathewson</p>
								</div>

								 <p>Mathewson maintained her player-coach partnership with Krikorian at the national level, citing him as a major influence on her entire athletic career.</p>
								 <p>“It's been really neat to go on this journey together,” Mathewson said. “I'm extremely grateful for all that he's taught me, not just in the water but specifically outside the water – how to strive to be better and give it your all, all the time, not just when people are looking.”</p>
								 <p><b>The road to Rio</b></p>
								 <p>With seven former and current Bruins on the current U.S. national team, there is a strong UCLA presence at the international level of women’s water polo. Rachel Fattal, Hill and Alys Williams have taken time off from school to represent the U.S. in the pool during the months to come.</p>
								 <p>Compared to the 2012 Olympic team, the current group of women is much younger and features only four returning players. Mathewson views the large number of newcomers as an asset.<p>
								 	<p>“There's a lot of youthfulness, but it’s nice because they're full of energy and enthusiasm,” Mathewson said. “You're inspired by it and motivated to take things a little bit lighter. It’d be boring if we were all exactly the same.”</p>
								 	<p>Still, certain challenges are inevitable at the highest level of the sport. With the national team consisting of the best water polo players in the country, some issues arise from the team’s diverse and varying collegiate backgrounds.</p>
								 	<p>“I think one of the challenges at the Olympic level for me has been trying to get the team to mesh, quite honestly,” Krikorian said. "We have players that are supposed to play as a cohesive unit, who have spent years battling each other on the collegiate scene. When you talk about players from UCLA, USC and Stanford, those are some heavy rivalries.”</p>
								 	<p>In order to improve the overall team dynamic, Krikorian leads without any sort of bias or preference in practices and competition. Based on their unified performances so far, it seems that he has largely rendered this challenge obsolete.</p>
								 	<p>“I don't look at them as Bruins or Cardinal or Trojans,” said Krikorian. “What we're trying to do is form the best team possible, so it doesn't matter what university they're from. They have to make this team on their own merit, drive and work ethic.”</p>

									</div>


								 	<p>This seems true for Hill, who has built strong friendships among her teammates even with the contentions they may have had at the collegiate level.</p>
								 	<p>“Adam makes it a point to have it be about Team USA, so there really aren't that many conversations about where everyone went to school or that sort of thing,” Hill said. “It really shows you that even if you're on different teams and you don't get along for a certain part, we're all on similar paths.”</p>
								 	<p>For Hill and her current teammates, their path is an exciting one. This past weekend, Team USA dominated the FINA Women's Intercontinental Tournament in Lewisville, Texas, beating Australia in the final round 6-5 to claim the gold.</p>
								 	<p>Things look promising as the qualifying tournament draws nearer. With his sights set on a second trip to the Olympics, Krikorian looks forward to another opportunity to bringing the U.S. a victory in one of the most celebrated international arenas.</p>
								 	<p>“Honestly, that’s one of the things I enjoy most: combining forces in some way to represent something much larger than ourselves,” Krikorian said.</p>
								 	<p>Preparing for the work, travel and press demanded by the Olympic journey, Krikorian continues to expand his extraordinary success. Cleaning the office will just have to wait.</p>

							  <h3 class="part2">Women's water polo player brings national team experience to Bruins</h3>
							  <h4>By  <a class="author" title="Posts by Author" href="//dailybruin.com/author/savannah-shapiro/" rel="author">
								Savannah Shapiro</a>
							  </h4>
							  <h2>Sports Writer</h2>
							    <p>It is rare to find someone in Canada playing water polo. The pools are located inside due to the cold,
							     rain, and snow. There are swimming leagues in the summer, but the window to compete is small.
							      So when redshirt Alexa Tielmann took up the sport, she was surprised how much she took to it.</p>

							    <p>Now, after spending a whole year training with the Canadian national team, Tielmann has competed
							     at the highest level of water polo and she couldn't see herself playing anything else.</p>

							    <p>The process of getting to that level, however, was not easy.</p>

								<p>Before water polo, there were other sports. After trying soccer, basketball and dance
								 Tielmann decided to follow the summertime tradition of participating in the swimming program. </p>

								<p>&#8220;I did swimming right before I tried water polo and I enjoyed that, but I was never the fastest
								 or the best,&#8221; Tielmann said.</p>

								<p>Although Tielmann still enjoyed swimming in the summer with her hometown swimming club, it was water
								 polo club coach Ian Mitchell, who was affiliated with the swiming club,  who convinced Tielmann to come 
								 out for a practice.</p>

								  <div class="pullquote">
										<p class="pullquotetext">
										  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the natural talent at first. So when I was younger, it wasn&#8217;t my aspiration
								 to go off to school down in the states &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know about that when I first started 
								 playing,&#8221; Tielmann said. &#8220;It just took a while for me to come into the player that I am now.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p class="quote-author">Tielmann</p>
									</div>

								<p>&#8220;I was pretty tall so my coach was like, &#8216;You should just try it.&#8217; So I tried it and 
									I don&#8217;t know, I fell in love with it,&#8221; Tielmann said.</p>

								<p>She was 11 then, and never really stopped. It was uncommon to be playing water polo  in Tielmann&#8217;s 
									hometown of Abbotsford, Canada, but with the extreme amount of time she spent in the pool, it became a passion.</p>

								<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of  random that I came to play it,&#8221; Tielmann said. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely
								 growing a lot . . . especially where I live now so that&#8217;s really good and awesome to see. 
								 Definitely a lot more kids are starting to play than when I started to get into it intensely."</p>


								<p>When you think big Canadian sports, water polo is not very high on that list, and when you compare 
									the popularity of the sport in Canada to Southern California, it's not even close. <br /></p>

								<p>&#8220;Compared to SoCal, we&#8217;re not quite there,&#8221; said Canadian Senior Women&#8217;s National 
									Team coach Justin Oliveira. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s as popular as it is in SoCal, but
									 it&#8217;s definitely an amateur sport and depending on where you are at in Canada, it is a popular summer
									  sport.&#8221;<br /></p>

								<p>The sport continued to grow in Canada as did Tielmann&#8217;s love and passion for it. During the 10th grade,
								 she made her first national team roster and it wasn&#8217;t until then that she began to think that she may be 
								 able to play water polo at a higher level.</p>


								<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the natural talent at first. So when I was younger, it wasn&#8217;t my aspiration
								 to go off to school down in the states &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know about that when I first started 
								 playing,&#8221; Tielmann said. &#8220;It just took a while for me to come into the player that I am now.&#8221;</p>


								<p>Tielmann participated in the summer water polo camps that UCLA held every year during the summer after her
								 sophomore and junior year in high school. The Canadian caught the eye of UCLA's coaching staff, who began the
								  process of getting her to play for the Bruins. For Tielmann, UCLA was her No. 1 choice and the only recruiting
								   trip she needed to take. </p>
								 <p>&#8220;Alexa was always a very coachable athlete,&#8221; Oliveira said. &#8220;When 
								   you&#8217;re coaching, she would always look for feedback and ask how she could get better. Those are great qualities
								    in an athlete and great qualities in an elite athlete who is always looking for that edge to 
								    get better.&#8221;<br /></p>


								    <div class="pullquote2">
									<p class="pullquote2text">
									  "After I am done at UCLA, there are so many options for me to continue on with water polo," Tielmann said.
								 "I just might go back with the next team for the next cycle in hopes of the 2020 Olympics."
									</p>
									<p class="quote-author">Tielmann</p>
								</div>

								<p>Heading into the 2015 season, Tielmann made the decision to take a year off from UCLA when asked to train 
									with the Canadian national team. In doing so, she exposed herself to a new level of competition and added 
									new aspects to her game.</p>

								<p>&#8220;I just decided that&#8217;s what I want to do," Tielmann said. "I want to try and be a part of the team
								 for the next cycle for this Olympics coming up.&#8221;</p>

								<p>In the midst of a competitive pool crowded with strangers, there was one familiar face. Tielmann and fellow
								 British Columbia native Carmen Eggens knew each other before they both began training with the national team.</p>

								<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny because we both are from BC so we kind of came up through water polo together; 
									she played at a separate club, but I&#8217;ve known her since she started playing and I knew of her,&#8221; 
									Eggens said.</p>

								<p>After spending a year with the women&#8217;s senior national team, Tielmann made the decision to return to 
									UCLA for  the 2016 season. For Tielmann, she didn't feel like it was her time to stay with the national team. 
									Tielmann was receiving little playing time and in the long run, UCLA would allow Tielmann to continue her 
									education and compete at a high level.  </p>

								<p>&#8220;She chose to go back to UCLA this year. Obviously it was a difficult decision for her to make, 
									but I think for her it&#8217;s a good one," Oliveira said. "She&#8217;s going to be getting a lot of playing
									 experience there at UCLA and she&#8217;s under the leadership of a great coach."<br /></p>

								<p>Although 2016 was not Tielmann's year to compete at the Summer Olympics, she hasn't ruled out 2020 just yet.</p>

								<p>"After I am done at UCLA, there are so many options for me to continue on with water polo," Tielmann said.
								 "I just might go back with the next team for the next cycle in hopes of the 2020 Olympics."<br /></p>

								 <p>For now, she is just focused on this season for the Bruins.</p>

							    <p>Swim lanes were rolled up, water polo nets were flung into the pool and the local water polo club began warming
							     up for practice. <br /></p>

							    <p>Four-year-old Rachel Fattal floated amidst the activity, waiting for her parents to pick her
							     up from a swimming lesson. </p>
							    <p>The curious kid drifted over to a clump of yellow Mikasa water polo balls and attempted to balance 
							    	them on top of her head. Her hands were too small to grasp the ball and her arms not yet strong 
							    	enough to throw it more than a couple feet.</p>

							    <p>Fattal, now an attacker for UCLA women's water polo, no longer has any problem gripping a water polo ball, 
							    	and no problem shooting past the top defenders in the country. Fifteen years of training and preparation 
							    	propelled her into both the collegiate and international water polo spotlight. </p>

							    <p>&#8220;I think in sports you see it very often where someone is very talented but maybe doesn&#8217;t love the
							     sport they play, or someone who works really hard but isn&#8217;t that talented,&#8221; said UCLA coach Brandon
							      Brooks. &#8220;Rachel has a lot of key elements &#8211; she has the talent to be great, the competitiveness
							       to set high goals and expectations and the work ethic to reach them.&#8221;</p>

							     <p>Fattal has always carried her strong work ethic and competitiveness in every aspect of her sporting
							      career, which led her to take an Olympic redshirt year in 2016 and apply every effort to make the national
							       team roster. </p><p>&#8220;I have never met anyone with more energy,&#8221; said senior defender Charlotte 
							       Pratt. &#8220;On our days off after tournaments, I would wake up to her coming back from a run or a swim. 
							       She never takes a single day off."</p><p>Because of her young start, Fattal is accustomed to going the extra 
							       mile to improve her strengths and weaknesses, representing the USA since she was a mere teenager. </p>

							        

							     <p>Fattal entered what is known as the &#8220;Olympic Pipeline&#8221; in water polo at a young age. It is the
							      gateway to the Olympics &#8211; a status that most young athletes aspire toward, but only a few can reach.
							       Young players are invited to join national teams early in their careers. Since she was 14 years old, Fattal
							        was in the pipeline, joining the ranks of the youth team, junior team and now the senior national team. <br /></p>

							       Tournament in Lewisville, Texas and the upcoming qualifications. </p>



							       <p>&#8220;Everyone that is the best at
							        the college level is most likely going to be on an international team,&#8221; Fattal said. &#8220;For other
							         countries, it&#8217;s going to be the best players that they have. It&#8217;s going to be faster, everyone&#8217;s
							          going to be just as good as you and just as fast as you.&#8221;</p><p>***</p><p>The sound of a cheering crowd 
							          and the steady drum roll of a high school band welcomed the team to Texas where the women were greeted with 
							          lines of fans. The arrivals terminal at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport was packed with an enthusiastic
							           welcoming committee that rivaled any crowd that the national team had previously experienced. </p>

						

							     <p>&#8220;It was absolutely amazing,&#8221; Fattal said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never ever had that. We are a 
							     	California-based team, and water polo is huge in California and we have never ever had that. And it was so 
							     	unreal and so unexpected.&#8221;</p><p>As Fattal weaved her way through the lines of fans, young aspiring water
							     	 polo players bombarded Fattal with pictures and T-shirts for her to autograph - a novel experience for the 
							     	 national team attacker. </p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not famous, I just play water polo. This is just what I have
							     	  done my whole life,&#8221; Fattal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredible when someone looks up to you the way that
							     	   these kids looked up to us in Texas.&#8221;</p>

								<p>The fan base last month in Texas was huge for Fattal and the national team. The stands were packed every
								 night for all six games in the FINA tournament, cheering on the U.S. National team. The senior team went on to
								  sweep the tournament in Texas and moved on to the Olympic Qualification Tournament. </p>
		       
								<p>&#8220;The Olympics ... it is like nothing else. It is the world&#8217;s highest level,&#8221; Brooks 
									said. &#8220;You mix the intense competition of trying to be one of the 13 best at your sport in the entire 
									country, which is a really cool thing to think that someone feels that they&#8217;re going to be one of ... the 
									very top athletes in the country or the world.&#8221;</p>

								<p>International qualifiers for the Olympics are only a few weeks away and Fattal can feel the anticipation
								 for Rio 2016 growing stronger. </p><p>&#8220;Hopefully if we qualify and I let myself start thinking about
								  Rio, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be crazy and I am going to be super excited,&#8221; Fattal said. &#8220;This
								   was in my dreams for many years now. It was always &#8216;2016 2016 Rio here we go&#8217; so I can only guess
								    how excited I&#8217;m going to be.&#8221;</p>

								<p>Although water polo has evolved for Fattal from a new and exciting hobby as a 4-year-old to a job that 
									demands constant attention as a 22-year-old, she has always maintained the outlook that water polo 
									should be fun.</p>

								<p>&#8220;We do what we do because we love it and because we have fun doing it,&#8221; Fattal 
									said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the most important thing about any sport. ... Yes, it&#8217;s my job.
									 Yeah, it might suck at times, but at the end of the day I love playing water polo.&#8221;</p>
