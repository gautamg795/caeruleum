      Jake Warden hustled fresh bunches of ripened bananas onto empty shelves, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow. He tossed the empty cardboard box onto a stack near his cart, which was piled high with boxes. Customers chatted with each other and questioned clerks about produce while mingling with ambient music playing over the store's speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employees in the Ralphs produce department have their hands full - in both senses of the word. They all hold down 48-hour-per-week jobs with one day off, and they also maintain lives outside the produce section with second jobs, school or social events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden has been working at Ralphs for 12 years and at the Westwood Ralphs for the last three. After joining the meat department, promotion opportunities stagnated and he decided to move to produce. For him, produce is the best department to work in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're left alone kind of, and your success hinges on yourself; you don't necessarily have someone watching over you all the time," Warden said. "You have to have that intrinsic motivation to get things done."
    </p>

        On a typical day, Carrillo gets home from his shift at LAX at 2:15 a.m. His alarm for his shift at Ralphs rings at 4:30 a.m.
        </p>

    <p>
      Amid the cacophony of the store, the employees focus primarily on filling gaps among the fruit and vegetables, which includes replacing produce that has been out too long with fresh produce. They also help customers who are looking for specific products, such as organic oranges or locally grown produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no particular structure to the day, in a sense, because it's whatever is needed at the time," Warden said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Warden received a certificate in music theory, he said he is now so invested in working at Ralphs that he sees his future in retail management. He wants to eventually become head of the produce department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden works 48 hours each week with only one day off, which he said is common for employees at Ralphs, particularly in the produce department. He said it's difficult to maintain a reasonable social life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's unfortunate, they talk about making a strong effort of making that work-life balance here, but that doesn't happen," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudy Carrillo, a produce clerk and the assistant to the produce manager, also works 48 hours per week transferring spoiled produce to the compost bin and transporting new fruits and vegetables from the back. Yet he maintains a second job as a baggage handler for American Airlines at Los Angeles International Airport.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a typical day, Carrillo gets home from his shift at LAX at 2:15 a.m. His alarm for his shift at Ralphs rings at 4:30 a.m. Still, he sustains his energy with healthy snacks like bananas, power bars and Naked juices and by taking a nap between his Ralphs and LAX shifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think about it," Carrillo said. "I just do it, I don't stress about it, it's like a routine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrillo has been working for American Airlines for almost as long as he has at Ralphs - 16 years compared to 20. He's spent the majority of his time at Ralphs in the produce section, starting as a courtesy clerk. He continued to turn down job openings that weren't in the produce department since he had become a vegetarian at the time of his hire, which fostered a desire to work with fresh fruits and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was like, 'No, I'll wait for produce,' and they didn't understand why," Carrillo said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrillo said he enjoys helping customers find what they need and getting to know the regulars. He can quote some customers' shopping lists from memory and said they joke that he should just have all their items set aside when they get there, since he knows the time they'll arrive as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Albia, also a produce clerk, finds pleasure in the produce department as well. He said he often sees the same people come in, day after day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a health administration student at Cal State Northridge, Albia started replenishing Roma tomatoes at Ralphs to help pay for rent. He keeps busy with an internship at the Northridge Hospital Medical Center in addition to his job at Ralphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his classes are now online, he previously had to juggle in-person classes at Northridge with his shifts at Ralphs in Westwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before, my (work) schedule was a little different," Albia said. "It was difficult but not that bad. The times of the classes and stuff worked out a little better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite juggling a job, an internship, online classes and a social life, Albia still believes the produce department at Ralphs is a rewarding place to work in. Carrillo agrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just enjoy what I do," Carrillo said. "Kind of surprising, 'cause some people don't. But I do."

      <p>
      It was early - too early, thought Brenda Castellon. The usual crowd around the Ralphs bakery counter was thin. After all, it was 4 in the morning, and Castellon stifled a yawn as she watched the cake decorator. He looked glum, thumbing through the thick stack of pink order forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castellon felt a sudden urge to help. Even though she was the manager, she felt bad leaving the cake decorator alone for hours with the colored bags of buttercream frosting. She picked up the bag with apprehension, as it was her first time swirling icing on the cake. The decorator, noticing her fear of damaging the cupcake, told Castellon to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The design comes from the tip (of the pastry bag), so I just let myself not be afraid. I started with cupcakes, then I picked the (icing) spatula up," Castellon said. "I grabbed a small little cake and started doing simple things. All of a sudden, I'm now doing all of the cakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Castellon has been the cake decorating specialist at the Westwood Ralphs for the past three years and has worked with the company for a total of 27 years. She is assisted by a team of employees in the bakery department who take custom orders, handwrite messages on cakes and act as a support system for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decorating the special-request cakes and cupcakes is the sole domain of Castellon, who is the only person in the Westwood Ralphs with the knowledge and skill to do so, said Jasmine Melendez, a bakery department employee who has been at Ralphs for six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castellon arrives at the store at 3:30 a.m. to begin decorating the cakes and cupcakes. In anticipation of the holiday season, Valentine's Day, Halloween and Mother's Day, she arrives at 2 in the morning to accommodate the increased demand.

    <p>
      She decorates cakes with regard to the pickup time: Her customers, who are often people working in the surrounding office buildings, sometimes pick up their custom cakes between 4 and 6 in the morning before they go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual clients who order from the bakery department are from UCLA faculty, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and homes in the surrounding neighborhoods, said Vicky Cervera Enriquez, a bakery employee who has been working at Ralphs for nine years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melendez said fraternities and sororities hosting large events and students celebrating birthdays will order cakes, but those instances comprise a smaller percentage of orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cervera Enriquez said she tries to assist with frosting and writing messages when the orders back up. Before she became an employee at Ralphs, Cervera Enriquez trained as a pastry chef at Le Cordon Bleu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until a year ago, Cervera Enriquez worked in restaurants such as Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles concurrently with her employment at Ralphs in Westwood. Cervera Enriquez left the restaurant for Ralphs in search of a more laid-back lifestyle after the chaos of plating desserts at Bottega Louie burned her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cervera Enriquez said the strangest request she received was when a customer asked her to write "isoos iirooi" on a cake with a smiley face underneath the words. Cervera Enriquez, not knowing the language of the message, asked the customer if the message was spelled correctly. The customer told her it was correct and left, leaving Cervera Enriquez utterly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Castellon, piping elaborate whipped cream designs on cakes comes with challenges. Castellon lamented her chipped burgundy nail polish, a result of her intense hand-washing during continuous cake icing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't have jewelry or cute (designs)," Castellon said. "Don't spend too much money on your fingernails. It's money wasted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Cervera Enriquez and Melendez hope to open their own bakeries in the future. Melendez aspires to own a bakery attached to a flower shop to cater to weddings and other special occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cervera Enriquez grew up in a baking family. Her grandparents, who owned a small bakery in Mexico, would bake pastries for her when they visited. She hopes to open a family business someday - her mother bakes, her sister is involved in marketing and Cervera Enriquez knows how to plate desserts and decorate pastries from her days at Bottega Louie and Le Cordon Bleu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castellon, however, sees cake decorating as a job to support her family as a single parent. Because she is constantly working inside a building, she hopes to spend her days outside gardening, painting or driving a bus when she retires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, she said she has made a conscious decision to be satisfied with her job, which allows her to unleash her creativity on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either you decide to be unhappy or you decide to be happy," Castellon said. "I decided to be happy, and I am happy with my cakes."

      As the daily lunch rush begins, the Westwood Ralphs deli staff works fast, taking orders and cooking entrees like macaroni and cheese and fried chicken. Carts full of bread fly in and out of the deli kitchen as a constant exchange of cold cuts overtakes the space above the glass countertops.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, behind the flurry of meat cutting, the employees behind the deli counter at Ralphs have dreams of pursing acting, literature, photography, fashion and counseling that go far beyond making lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rings up a customer at the deli cash register, Timothy Kauthen, a Ralphs employee since April, said he has dreamed of becoming a musical performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kauthen said he began in the performing arts in middle school, singing with his class. After entering high school, he participated in choir groups, drama classes and musicals like "Little Shop of Horrors" and "Legally Blonde."

          Timothy Kauthen, a Ralphs employee since April, said he has dreamed of becoming a musical performer.
        </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the future, Kauthen said he dreams of performing in a musical like "The Lion King" in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to Kauthen in the meat section of the deli, Aaron Goodell, a Ralphs employee since June, operates a deli slicer as he prepares Boar's Head roast beef for a waiting customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Goodell spends his afternoons weighing packages of meat on the metallic scales of the deli, his true passions are for horror literature and graphic arts. As a child, he was introduced to the horror genre after discovering Edgar Allan Poe's "Tales of Mystery and Imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It made a real impression on me," Goodell said. "I've always had a special love of strange, weird, unpleasant things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodell said he loves international horror conventions where authors and producers discuss horror literature and movies. He also enjoys reading Warren Comics, in which sea monsters, vampires and other horrific creatures run rampant in the inked pages of a comic book. Goodell aspires to run his own business as a small publisher.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Goodell finishes with a customer, Elijah Brickley steps behind him into the aisles of deli cutters and begins to wipe the slicers down with a battered rag, one of his many tasks since beginning work at Ralphs in March. With just a few quick swipes, he removes a layer of grease from the slicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a break from cleaning, Brickley said aspects of the arts world like fashion, film and photography inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brickley started to take pictures two years ago, focusing on his friends who skateboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he doesn't skate himself, Brickley centers his photography and film mostly around his skater friends by making montages of their skateboard tricks and photographing them skating together. He said his favorite picture is of his friends overlooking the Los Angeles River on an old bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "(Photography) is like expression pretty much; it's that momentary story you get to tell and show to everybody," Brickley said. "It's your perspective but in kind of an alternative way."
    </p>
    <p>
      While frowning at his Ralphs uniform, Brickley said he also has been trying to design his own fashion line. Using shirts and jeans he finds on sale, he cuts and tears different designs into the material, creating new clothing combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the meat department, Claribel Mata, a Ralphs employee since August, finishes her shift around 2 p.m. by making one last Holy Pepper Inferno grilled cheese, a spicy customer favorite among those who come to Ralphs deli for lunch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking her plastic gloves off for the day, Mata said she also works as a family counselor outside of the deli at a Los Angeles family counseling center with her degree in psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mata said she loves working at the family counseling center and hopes to go back to school to build her own private counseling practice. However, she can't seem to leave her job at Ralphs because she has built relationships with several customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although each deli employee has their own dreams outside of the deli, Kauthen said working at Ralphs gives good cooking experience and pays well, which allows him to go home and cook with his family. He also said the customers are friendly when they order and help make the job more fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I was supposed to just do this (work at the deli) for like a month or two," Mata said. "But it's hard to just leave. You actually get attached to the people, the co-workers, the customers; I just like to help."

          The sushi chefs at the Ralphs in Westwood trained at international culinary institutes and now serve up sushi rolls of rice and fish to local customers. (Justine Sto.Tomas/Daily Bruin senior staff)

    <div class="row content-text">
      <p>Customers saunter<b> </b>around<b> </b>the sushi counter, eyeing moist slices of fresh salmon and tuna<b> </b>resting upon fluffy mountains of rice. While the customers deliberate on what they will choose for the day&#8217;s lunch, the chefs work swiftly behind the counter preparing the fish, cooking the rice and diligently fashioning the sushi to maintain an inviting presentation.</p>
      <p>But chefs had to travel far to put the sushi on the shelves. Min Mynt, the sous chef at the Westwood Ralphs sushi counter, traveled nearly 8,000 miles from his home in Myanmar to take his culinary skills to the United States.</p>
      <p>Mynt has been working at Ralphs for <b></b>six months, but has been crafting sushi for much longer. He attended culinary school in Yangon, Myanmar, where he focused on Asian cuisine.</p>

      </div>
      <p>“I know a lot about Asian food by now, but sushi is my favorite thing to make,” Mynt said.</p>
      <p>Mynt<b> </b>worked as a sous chef at the Geisha House in West Hollywood. His next endeavor was Westwood&#8217;s Ralphs, where he hopes to acquire<b> </b>the necessary skills to become the next franchisee for the Advanced Fresh Concepts Franchise Corporation, the store&#8217;s sushi supplier. Mynt said AFC will soon be looking for a new franchisee.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of friends that are already franchisees so I know a lot about how it works,” Mynt said. “But for me, there is a lot more I want to learn about how to run a sushi bar, especially management. I want to learn every single possible thing before I take that position.”</p>
      <p><b></b>Running the sushi bar begins with adhering to a rigid and consistent sushi-making schedule on a day-to-day basis. When employees come in each morning, the first thing they do is make rice. They test the<b> </b>pH <b></b>of the rice to ensure a perfect balance of rice and water, giving the rice its sticky consistency and serving as the structure for a sushi roll.</p>
      <p>At 6 a.m., <b></b>the employees pull out their rolling mats and put on their chefs&#8217; hats.<b> </b>Preparation ranges from quicker rolls such as the California roll, to more complex ones such as hybrid sushi, which is served on a large platter and consists of a rainbow of<b> </b>fish including yellowtail, halibut and salmon. Mynt said the platters require the most effort to make, which makes the process longer.</p>
      <p>“There are so many items here, I can’t even remember all the names,” Mynt said as he pointed to drawers full of sushi labels<b></b>. A tablet rests next to the drawers, which is used exclusively for making the labels on the sushi boxes.</p>
      <p>Mynt said he impresses upon his team that one of the most important aspects of making<b> </b>sushi is to craft it the sushi as visually appealing as possible.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people come to the bar, but my question is,<b> </b>&#8216;What do you do first?&#8217; You’re going to look at the sushi,” Mynt said. “You want a beautiful presentation, or you won’t buy it. The way it looks is going to make you pick it up.”</p>
      <p>Yasutaka Kawamura, a sushi chef, started working at Ralphs in May, but is no stranger to the art of sushi making. Kawamura went to a sushi institute culinary school in Japan, and placed third in the World Sushi Cup in 2012. While he also has his teaching credentials and a black belt in karate, Kawamura said his true passion derives from the challenges that come with making sushi.<b> </b></p>
      <p>“Every year there is a new favorite sushi that people like, so it’s always challenge, challenge, challenge, and that’s good,” Kawamura said.</p>
      <p>Mynt prepared California rolls with one of the newly filed knives<b>, </b>which is key to cutting the sushi for an aesthetic display. He carefully spread the sticky rice onto the nori, <b></b>sprinkled on the sesame seeds and added slices of imitation crab, cucumber and avocado, then rolled the sushi<b> </b>using a bamboo mat to firmly shape the roll before slicing. Finally, the last step before packaging: He sliced the roll into eight pieces, which were all the same size to allow for a neat presentation.</p>
      <p>Antonio Gonzales, a manager at Ralphs, said<b> </b>the employees at the sushi counter work conscientiously to preserve the appearance of the sushi.</p>
      <p>&#8220;These guys are like machines,&#8221; Gonzales said. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely amazing to see how fast they work to produce the sushi and how organized they are while doing so.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Until Mynt eventually reaches his goal of becoming a franchisee, he will continue to appreciate serving customers, and said they have been the source of some of his best memories at the store.</p>
      <p>“I just really like to make sushi,” Mynt said. “That is my living job and I respect it.”</p>
